variables1
Create a variable and assign it a value.

# Ruby uses the snake_case convention for variable names 
# instead of the camelCase convention like other languages.
first_name = "Tyler"



interpolation1
Show how to use string interpolation and concatenation. 

# Strings can be in single or double quotes but note that interpolation 
# will only work with double quotes. 

# String interpolation
name = "Tyler"
greeting = "Hello, #{name}, it is good to see you."

# String concatenation
new_name = "Bill"
new_greeting = "Hello, " + new_name + ", it is good to see you."
