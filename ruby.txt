***1variables1***
Create a variable and assign it a value.

# Ruby uses the snake_case convention for variable names instead of the camelCase convention like other languages.
first_name = "Tyler"





*** 2interpolation1
Show how to use string interpolation and concatenation. 

# Strings can be in single or double quotes but note that interpolation will only work with double quotes. 

# String interpolation
name = "Tyler"
greeting = "Hello, #{name}, it is good to see you."

# String concatenation
new_name = "Bill"
new_greeting = "Hello, " + new_name + ", it is good to see you."





*** 3methods1
Create a method and then invoke it.

def say_hello
    puts "Hello!"
end

say_hello





*** 4methods2
Create a method that takes parameters and then invoke it. 

def greeting(name, time_of_day)
    puts "Hello #{name}, it is a beautiful #{time_of_day}."
end

greeting("Dan", "morning")





*** 5methods3
Create a method with default arguments and then invoke it once while supplying arguments and once without supplying any arguments. 

def programmer_greeting(name="friend", language="JavaScript")
    puts "Hello #{name}, I heard you are a great #{language} programmer."
end

programmer_greeting("Sarah", "Python")
programmer_greeting





*** 6printing1
Show how to print multiple items both on the same line and then printed out on separate lines. 

item1 = "First thing to print."
item2 = "Second thing to print."
item3 = "Third thing to print."

print item1
print item2
print item3

puts

puts item1
puts item2
puts item3





*** 7return1
Show what a method will return by default and what it will return when the 'return' keyword is used. 

def names
    person1 = "John"
    person2 = "Bill"
    person3 = "Jessica"
end

# A method will return the value of the last statement by default. This example will return person3 with a value of 'Jessica'.
puts names


def names2
    person1 = "John"
    return person2 = "Bill"
    person3 = "Jessica"
end

# The return keyword will interupt the execution of the method and return the value of that line. This example will return person2 with a value of 'Bill'.
puts names2





*** 8pry1
Show how to use the pry gem for debugging.

# After requiring the pry gem, you can add binding.pry in your code to stop the code execution and open a new REPL. You can look at the value of variables and update the values. Type 'exit' to close. 

require 'pry'

def pry_testing
    thing1 = "This is the first variable"
    thing2 = 7
    thing3 = "Washington"
    binding.pry
end

pry_testing





*** 9scope1
Create a method and declare some variables both inside and outside the method. Show how scope determines which variables can be accessed from different locations in the program. 

var1 = "Ted"
var2 = "Bill"

def scope_method
    var3 = "Dawn"
    var4 = "Jill"

    # var2 will not print because it was definied outside the method but is being called inside the method. 
    puts var2

    #var4 will print becuase it was defined inside a method and is being called inside the method. 
    puts var4
end

scope_method

# var1 will print becuase it was definied outside a method and is also being called outside a method.
puts var1 

# var3 will not print because it was defined inside a method but is being called outside that method.
puts var3
