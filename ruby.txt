Create a variable and assign it a value.

# Ruby uses the snake_case convention for variable names instead of the camelCase convention like other languages.
first_name = "Tyler"





*** 2interpolation1
Show how to use string interpolation and concatenation. 

# Strings can be in single or double quotes but note that interpolation will only work with double quotes.

*** 7return1
Show what a method will return by default and what it will return when the 'return' keyword is used. 

def names
    person1 = "John"
    person2 = "Bill"
    person3 = "Jessica"
end

# A method will return the value of the last statement by default. This example will return person3 with a value of 'Jessica'.
puts names


def names2
    person1 = "John"
    return person2 = "Bill"
    person3 = "Jessica"
end

# The return keyword will interupt the execution of the method and return the value of that line. This example will return person2 with a value of 'Bill'.
puts names2





*** 8pry1
Show how to use the pry gem for debugging.

# After requiring the pry gem, you can add binding.pry in your code to stop the code execution and open a new REPL. You can look at the value of variables and update the values. Type 'exit' to close. 

require 'pry'

def pry_testing
    thing1 = "This is the first variable"
    thing2 = 7
    thing3 = "Washington"
    binding.pry
end

pry_testing





*** 9scope1
Create a method and declare some variables both inside and outside the method. Show how scope determines which variables can be accessed from different locations in the program. 

var1 = "Ted"
var2 = "Bill"

def scope_method
    var3 = "Dawn"
    var4 = "Jill"

    # var2 will not print because it was definied outside the method but is being called inside the method. 
    puts var2

    #var4 will print becuase it was defined inside a method and is being called inside the method. 
    puts var4
end

scope_method

# var1 will print becuase it was definied outside a method and is also being called outside a method.
puts var1 

# var3 will not print because it was defined inside a method but is being called outside that method.
puts var3 





*** 10truthy1
Show how to use the bang operator (!) to determine if something is truthy or falsey. 

# variable is assigned a string with a value of "hello". This is considered truthy. Using a single ! operator will return to oppsite of this which will be false. 
# Using the ! operator twice will take the opposite again and return true. 

# Note in Ruby only false and nil are considered falsey values. Everything else is truthy, even 0 and an empty string ''. 

variable = "hello"

puts variable
puts !variable
puts !!variable





*** 11boolean1
Show how to use the And and Or boolean operators. 

# For the And operator, both expressions must evaluate to true in order to return true.
puts true && true
puts true && false

# For the Or operator, only one expression must evaluate to true in order to return true. 
puts false || true
puts false || false





*** 12boolean1
Show how to use the comparison operators. 

puts "yellow" == "yellow"
puts "yellow" != "yellow"

puts 7 > 3
puts 7 < 3
puts 10 >= 10
puts 10 <= 10





*** 13conditional1
Write an if statement. 

dog = "tired"

if dog == "hungry"
    puts "Feed the dog."
elsif dog == "bored"
    puts "Walk the dog."
elsif dog == "tired"
    puts "Let the dog sleep."
else
    puts "The dog is fine."
end





*** 14conditional1
Write a case statement.

current_weather = "raining"

case current_weather
  when "sunny"
    puts "grab some sunscreen!"
  when "raining"
    puts "grab an umbrella"
  when "snowing"
    puts "bundle up"
end 





*** 15looping1
Write a loop that runs 10 times. 

counter = 0

loop do 
    counter = counter + 1

    puts "The loop has run #{counter} times."

    if counter >= 10
        break
    end
end





*** 16looping2
Write both a while loop and an until loop that runs 10 times. 

counter1 = 0
while counter1 < 10
    puts "This is the while loop"
    counter1 += 1
end


counter2 = 0
until counter2 == 10
    puts "This is the until loop"
    counter2 += 1
end





*** 17arrays1
Create an array of items. Show how to add new items both at the end of the array and at the beginning of the array. 

fruits = ["banana", "strawberry", "watermelon"]

# Both the shovel operator (<<) and the push method can be used to add items
# to the end of an array. 
fruits << "apple"
fruits.push("peach")

# The unshift method will add an item to the beginning of the array. 
fruits.unshift("grape")





*** 18arrays2
Create an array of items. Show how to remove items from both the end and the beginning of the array. 

fruits = ["peach", "apple", "banana", "strawberry", "watermelon"]

# The pop method will remove the last item from the array.
fruits.pop

# The shift method will remove the first item from the array. 
fruits.shift





*** 19arrays3
Create an array of items. Show how to access some of the different items in the array and how to look up the index of a specific item. 

fruits = ["peach", "apple", "banana", "strawberry", "watermelon"]

puts fruits[1]

# Putting a negative index number will start at the end of the array and work backwards. 
puts fruits[-2]

# The first and last methods can be used to find the first and last items in an array. 
puts fruits.first
puts fruits.last

# The index method will return the index number of the first item that matches the given argument. 
puts fruits.index("banana")





*** 20arrays4
Create an array of numbers. Show how to use methods to sort the array, reverse the array, show if a specific number is included in the array, and show the size of the array. 

numbers = [4, 8, 3, 5, 9]

# This will not modify the original array, use the sort! method instead if you want to modify the original. 
print numbers.sort
puts

# This will not modify the original array, use the reverse! method instead if you want to modify the original. 
print numbers.reverse
puts

puts numbers.include?(8)

puts numbers.size
